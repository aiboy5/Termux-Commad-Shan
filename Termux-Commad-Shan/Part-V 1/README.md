## 🚀 About The Project

This guide was created to be the definitive, beginner-friendly documentation for the **real power of Termux**—its ability to bridge the Linux command line with the Android Operating System.

Unlike other guides that mix in generic Linux commands, this handbook focuses exclusively on the tools that make Termux unique: `pkg` management, the extensive `termux-api`, and native shell utilities for automation and control.

## 🌐 Multi-Language Support

This handbook is available in multiple languages:
- **English (EN)**: Complete documentation with detailed explanations
- **Shan (SH)**: Shan language version (currently in development)

> Whether you're a curious beginner taking your first steps or a seasoned scripter looking for a comprehensive reference, this handbook has something for you.
